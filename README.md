#[Find Me A Fireteam](http://findmeafireteam.meteor.com)

##What

A website for helping players match make for end game activities in [Destiny](https://www.destinythegame.com/uk/en), where the game does not provide matchmaking.

##Why

1. At the time, i wasn't keen on how the current LFG sites ([destinylfg.com](http://www.destinylfg.com), [destinylfg.net](http://www.destinylfg.net)) worked - they have got much better recently
2. I wanted an excuse to play with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) :)
